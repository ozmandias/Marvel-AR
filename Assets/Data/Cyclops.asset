  name: Cyclops
  wiki: Scott Summers is a mutant with the ability to fire destructive optic beams
    from his eyes. As the first X-Man Cyclops, he has ascended from super hero field
    leader to a mutant revolutionary icon. The firstborn son of Major Chris Summers,
    Scott and his brother Alex witnessed the apparent murder of their parents by the
    Shi'ar Emperor D'ken. As an introspective orphan and in the clutches of the nefarious
    Mister Sinister, his mutant abilities first manifested. After escaping Sinister's
    orphanage, Summers was rescued by Professor Xavier, a fellow mutant who ran a
    school aimed at helping mutants to control their uncanny abilities.  As the leader
    of Xavier's X-Men, a task force with the goal of ensuring peaceful coexistence
    between humans and mutants, Cyclops guided other mutants in countless missions
    and adventures, and even became the headmaster of Xavier's School. When mutantkind
    was on the brink of extinction, Cyclops gradually transformed the X-Men into a
    more extremist faction to ensure the survival of mutants, even going to war against
    the Avengers during the coming of the Phoenix to Earth, an event that cost the
    life of his former mentor Xavier. As a revolutionary leader, Cyclops has become
    an iconic figure for all of mutantkind, amalgamating aspects of Xavier's dream
    and Magneto's ideals.  After Xavier returned, a mutant-exclusive nation was established
    on the living island of Krakoa, which completely reshaped mutant society. Cyclops
    has been assigned the nation's defense as the Captain Commander of Krakoa, being
    the de facto leader of the X-Men.[58] Alongside his wife, Jean Grey, Cyclops has
    decided to reform the X-Men as a Krakoan super-hero team fighting to protect the
    whole world.
