  wiki: Tony Stark is a genius inventor and billionaire industrialist, who suits up
    in his armor of cutting-edge technology to become the super hero Iron Man. The
    adopted son of weapons manufacturer Howard Stark, Tony inherited his family's
    company at a young age following his parents' death. While overseeing a manufacturing
    plant in a foreign country, Stark was kidnapped by local terrorists. Instead of
    giving in to his captors' demands to build weapons for them, Stark created a powerful
    suit of armor for himself to escape. Returning to America, Stark further upgraded
    the armor and put his vast resources and intellect to use for the betterment of
    the world as Iron Man, also quickly giving up weapons manufacturing, having experienced
    first-hand the horrors of war.  Tony kept his alter-ego a secret for most of his
    career, juggling his responsibilities as head of Stark Industries while becoming
    a key player in the superhuman community as Iron Man and founding the world's
    premier super hero team, the Avengers. Over the years, Stark has faced numerous
    enemies, such as the Mandarin, Justin Hammer, Iron Monger, and the Titanium Man,
    as well as many personal demons, most notably his addiction to alcohol. For many
    years, Tony covered for his alter-ego by claiming that Iron Man was his anonymous
    bodyguard, but Tony eventually brought his dual identity to the public light.  Recently,
    Iron Man was backed into a corner by the anti-mutant industrialist Feilong, who
    took advantage of Tony divesting himself from his company, Stark Unlimited, to
    acquire it and repurpose the Iron Man technology into mutant-hunting Stark Sentinels
    as part of his plans, alongside the think tank Orchis, to persecute mutantkind.
    Designing a new stealth armor to operate from the shadows, Iron Man joined forces
    with mutant telepath Emma Frost, working on the counter-offensive against Orchis
    and their global anti-mutant regime. Stark's efforts ultimately paid off with
    the creation of his Mysterium Armor, crafted from a rare metal whose existence
    was once theorized by Tony's father.
