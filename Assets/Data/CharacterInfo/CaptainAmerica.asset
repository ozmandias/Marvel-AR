  wiki: Cpt. Steven "Steve" Rogers a.k.a. Captain America, the First Avenger, was
    rejected by the U.S. Army during World War II due to numerous health problems.
    He ultimately volunteered for Project Rebirth where he received the Super-Soldier
    Serum developed by Dr. Abraham Erskine. The serum greatly enhanced his frail body
    to the peak of human physicality. As the Sentinel of Liberty, alongside his best
    friend Bucky Barnes and the Invaders, Rogers and others helped the Allies win
    the war, but not before he was lost at sea and frozen in ice in a form of suspended
    animation for decades. He was thawed out in the modern age to continue the battle
    alongside his new allies the Avengers. Cap is loyal to no politician or government
    and instead upholds the "timeless principles of freedom, equality, and justice
    of the American Dream".
