  wiki: "Wade Wilson is a human mutate capable of healing any injuries no matter how
    fatal they are. Wade got his healing factors embeded into his DNA from Wolverine's.
    During childhood, Wade had family issues that leads him to grow up to be a thug
    and criminal. Wade eventually became a mercenary after leaving home, he appeares
    to have joined the U.S. Army Special Forces but despite his superior skills, he
    was drummed out for not following orders that conflicted with his moral code.
    Wade was invited to join a clandestine group of CIA-sponsored mercenary assassins
    thanks to his military record, assured that his targets would all deserve death.
    Learning that he had developed 34 inoperable cancerous tumors, he even gave up
    his chemo treatments, not wishing to prolong things. Back in Canada, he was offered
    hope in the form of Department K, a special weapons development branch of the
    Canadian government. Wilson became a test subject in Department K\u2019s branch
    of the joint U.S./Canadian superhuman enhancement project, the Weapon X Program;
    his cancer was temporarily arrested via the implantation of a healing factor derived
    from another Department K agent, the mutant adventurer Wolverine.  Wilson was
    active in a covert field unit alongside the near-invulnerable Sluggo and the cyborgs
    Kane and Slayback. Vanessa herself was later affiliated with the team after having
    manifested mutant shapeshifting abilities, calling herself Copycat.  During one
    mission, Wilson killed his teammate Slayback. Shortly thereafter, his healing
    factor began to destabilise, bringing his cancer back from remission and causing
    deformities in his flesh. As a result, he was rejected from the Weapon X Program
    and sent to the Hospice, allegedly a government facility where failed superhuman
    operatives were treated. However, unknown to the Canadian government, the Hospice's
    patients served as experimental subjects for Doctor Killebrew and his sadistic
    assistant Ajax (known then as the Attending), with the patients placing bets in
    a \"deadpool\" as to how long each subject would live. Killebrew subjected Wilson
    to various torturous experiments for his own deranged satisfaction.  In due course,
    Wilson formed a romantic relationship with the cosmic entity Death, who regarded
    him as a kindred spirit. Wilson started trying to kill himself, to join Death
    - going so far as to start taunting Ajax by saying his real name (Francis) over
    and over, which earned him the respect of his fellow Hospice patients. Then Ajax,
    angered by Wilson\u2019s taunts, lobotomized Worm, the closest thing Wilson had
    to a friend. At Death\u2019s prompting, Wilson killed Worm to end his suffering.
    \ However, under Killebrew's rules, any patient who killed another was to be executed;
    Ajax subsequently tore out Wilson\u2019s heart and left him for dead, but Wilson\u2019s
    thirst for vengeance was so strong that it jump started his healing factor, regenerating
    his heart, although not curing his scarred body. Wilson then escaped the now-empty
    room and attacked the guards, making his way to Ajax. Wilson shot him in the chest
    with two automatic rifles, leaving him for dead. Taking the name Deadpool, he
    escaped from the Hospice with his fellow patients. Following his escape, Deadpool
    served for a time as an enforcer alongside the surgically altered criminal Hammerhead.
    He soon returned to his freelance mercenary activities, donning a costume in keeping
    with his new identity, \"Deadpool\"."
