  name: Wolverine
  wiki: Cursed with a berserker fury, the violent mutant known as Wolverine has a
    reputation of both as an outstanding super hero and as a lethal killer. Born as
    James Howlett to a wealthy Canadian family at the end of the 19th century, he
    was forced to abandon his family after the tragic manifestation of his bestial
    abilities of accelerated healing factor, keenly enhanced senses and bone claws
    in each hand. Adopting the name Logan, he wandered the world, living a long life
    filled with blood, war and betrayal, having vile Sabretooth as his archenemy,
    and the Japanese warrior Ogun as his sensei. Unfortunately, by acting as a lone
    wolf, Logan was an unwitting subject of the Weapon X Program and had his bones
    coated in indestructible Adamantium, becoming an even more lethal asset. Rescued
    and assisted by Mac and Heather Hudson, he joined Department H as a Canadian government
    operative known as the Wolverine.  Later, Logan was invited by Charles Xavier
    to join the X-Men, a team of heroes fighting for peace between humans and mutants.
    Proving to be a challenging addition to the X-Men due to his aggressive behavior,
    Wolverine was constantly in conflict with his fellow teammate Cyclops. However,
    he has gradually grown fond of the X-Men, considering them to be his new family.
    As a recurrent member of the X-Men, Wolverine has also become a noteworthy member
    of the Avengers. Moreover, he has been tasked to run the secret mutant strike
    team known as X-Force to protect mutantkind's interests by employing lethal force.
    Wolverine was also responsible for reforming the Jean Grey School after parting
    ways with Cyclops and leading his own faction of X-Men.  When all mutantkind was
    granted asylum by Professor Xavier on the mutant-exclusive nation of Krakoa, Wolverine
    was one of the first of its residents.[100] Although currently suspicious of the
    cost of this apparent safe place for mutants, Wolverine still works as the field
    leader of X-Force, which evolved as an intelligence organization in charge of
    special operations to counter-attack assaults against Krakoa.
